# Pod

Pod stands for Python Oxford Dictionary.

My girlfriend told me the desktop version of Oxford Dictionary is not so comfortable to use. So I write a LUI oxford dictionary. All the data is gathered from the web oxford dictionary.

## Installation

have no idea how to pack into to pip

## Usage

```pod <arg><word>```


1. ```pod -l <word>```

The program look up the word and shutdown

2. ```pod -d <word>```

The program look up the word and open the dictionary(refer to no.3)

3. ```pod```

Open the dictionary, you can shut it down by type fuck at the end of each line

4. ```pod <word>```

It is a abbrevation of no.1
