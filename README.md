# Pod

When programmer are doing some code work they hate to leave the keyboard. And dictionary is a fairly common used application for programmers who are not so good at English.(ex. me) However, there isn't a great dictionary application we can use in command line. 

Until now, there is one.

Pod stands for Python Oxford Dictionary. You can use this one without moving your hands away from the keyboards and get a accurate(or acceptable) result for the Oxford Dictionary.


## Installation

I have no idea how to pack this project into to pip.

## Usage

```pod <arg><word>```


1. ```pod -l <word>```

Look up the word and exit.

2. ```pod -d <word>```

Look up the word and open the dictionary (refer to no.3)

3. ```pod```

Open the dictionary, you can exit the program by typing "fuck" at the end of each line.

4. ```pod <word>```


Abbreviated version of (1).

## Little Story

My girlfriend told me the desktop version of Oxford Dictionary is not so platable to use. So I write a oxford dictionary command-line-version for her. When I finally introduced it to her, she said "what the fuck" in Chinese and then I believed I was wrongheaded at this, not a single non-programmer would use this kind of shit.
