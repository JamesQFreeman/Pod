# Pod

Pod stands for Python Oxford Dictionary.

My girlfriend told me the desktop version of Oxford Dictionary is not so comfortable to use. So I wrote a LUI Oxford Dictionary. All the data is gathered from the web version of the Oxford Dictionary.

## Installation

I have no idea how to pack this project into to pip.

## Usage

```pod <arg><word>```


1. ```pod -l <word>```

Look up the word and exit.

2. ```pod -d <word>```

Look up the word and open the dictionary (refer to no.3)

3. ```pod```

Open the dictionary, you can exit the program by typing "fuck" at the end of each line.

4. ```pod <word>```

Abbreviated version of (1).
